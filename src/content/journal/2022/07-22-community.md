# Notes on Community Building
*2022-07-13*

Throughout this program our 25 student group has been an absolute dream. We're a mix of masters and bachelor students ranging from ages 19-32 and everyone has been a unique and valuable contribution to our dynamic as a whole. Whenever even one person is out of the mix the dynamic always shifts somehow.

Here are some of my favorite things I've noticed that have helped people come together and meld the way we have. A mix of things I've tried myself and that other have done to help get us to where we are now, right at the end of the program.

## We ask each other how we're doing
It's so simple but it goes so far. It's inevitable that after 4 weeks in close quarters we're bound to see each others' up and downs. Being together so often can be stressful, it can be hard, but it also means there's always someone to notice if you're not feeling well. 

On one of the early days of the program I was feeling a little burnt out while jet lag was still very present and all the new social interaction had taken a toll. I was staring off into the distance probably looking a little zonked out but someone caught my eye and gave me a little wave as to ask if I was doing okay. I got to nod and give a little smile but it felt so nice that someone had noticed my little out of itness and cared.

Then a week and a half in I ended up passing out on my way to the bathroom (probably due to dehydration but it's still kind of up in the air) and everyone was so nice. Hannah was the one with me in the bathroom and was an absolute dream about it and then after Carey, on of our program directors, went back to the hotel with me I received messages from multiple people asking how I was and if I needed anything. All the next day people checked in and I felt so lucky to have all these people care about what was, in the end, a weird fluke.

## We maintain an open platform for connection
Now it's time to shoutout Sandy, the originator of the Discord server that saved us all multiple times over. This Discord server as of now has 18 text channels each for their own specific purpose ranging from announcements to photo-dump (my personal favorite) and meet-up-planning. 

Everyday people use the discord to talk to each other and let people know any sort of plans coming up so people can join in when they want to. It's been so lovely to see people be so open, everyone can pick and choose different outings based on just what they want to do that day but there's not any pressure to go. People just give the option. 

It's also become especially useful during the quarantine era of our trip when we could crowdsource aid for people when they needed food, medicine, or even just covid coping stratgies. It gives people the easy opportunity to help and ask for help whenever needed.

## We pose fun questions for everyone to answer

What's a better way of getting to know someone than asking them questions? Every question on this list (that I came up with) came naturally from a conversation I was having with someone and once I realized how good of a question it was then throughout the day I would try to hit everyone in the group to hear their take. The trick is to ask *everybody* not only to make everyone included but it's just so wonderful to hear everyone's answers, many you wouldn't expect! Everyone has a rich inner life and asking these sorts of questions helps open that up a little.

**If you were to enter a barter situation what kind of expertise or handmade products would you offer up?** This was maybe my favorite to ask because not only did I end up with a pretty useful list that I'm planning on referencing when back in Seattle but it really made people think about their unique skills and offerings to each other in a simply helpful context. Most people at first didn't know how to answer, they'd get flustered and say something along the lines of "hmmm I don't really think there is anything" but after a couple of minutes of me just applying what I hope was gentle pressure they pop out the most amazing answers! We had everything from "I can host a fancy sushi making night" to "making someone a piece of furniture" to "I can just go somewhere new with someone so they don't feel alone".

**If you could turn into a piece of furniture what would piece of furniture would you be?** This question belongs to Olivia Oomen and I'm adding it in here anyways because this question brings out such an interesting side of people! It's really nice to see how someone imagines themselves in relation to a house setting and how poeple would interact with them. Some people see themselves as utilitarian objects, there to help other people, while some maybe see themselves as comforting or just beautiful objects that they had growing up.

**If you were to get a Kermit the frog tattoo which Kermit the frog would you get tattooed?** Who would have thunk that everyone has such a special and unique connection to Kermit the frog?? We ranged from "I'd let my grandfather decide because he really likes frogs" to "the original Jim Henson skethces" and most commonly "kermit playing the banjo with a rainbow in the background".

## We get people drawing

Sometimes it's just not the right time for words. Giving people the opportunity to draw lets people engage and connect using a different wavelength than a normal conversation. 

**Draw the person in front of you -** I've already mentioned this in a previous post but at our introductory dinner I got out a piece of paper and wrote down the words "Draw the person in front of you" at the top and then passed it down the table. It was so fun to see everyone's recreations and get everyone involved in a common cause. I think the dinner would have been as lovely as ever without this little project but I think it added to a sense of community and gave people a break from straight conversation that can get tiring after a long day of class and a multiple hour long dinner into of itself.

**Draw a tree -** Talk about needing a break. On one of our days during the weekend-long Amsterdam museum blitz when we activated our *i am amsterdam* cards me and a couple other people found ourselves absolutely pooped at the botanical gardens. We got in and after two seconds of walking around the greenhouse found ourselves just unable to move from the first bench we could find on the way in. The only thing that got us to move around was for me to offer the option "why don't we find another bench to sit on?". So that we did, we ended up in another greenhouse in a small couryard with big potted trees all around. We were all to tired for any words or efforts in getting up so I got out a piece of paper and passed it around asking the 3 other people there to draw one of the trees around us. So that's what we did for 30 minutes or so, just sitting in silence and drawing trees. We were able to engage in an activity together while still being able to relax, and enjoy the scenery in peace.
