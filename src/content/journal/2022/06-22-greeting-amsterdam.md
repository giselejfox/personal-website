The first day in Amsterdam was a rough one. I took the overnight flight straight from Seattle which left Saturday the 18th at 1ish and arrived to Amsterdam the next day at 8am. That means that I should have slept the whole way to set my body on the right path but there was little to no sleep on the flight. However, some excitement did result from what would be an otherwise cramped and tiring experince. I ended up talking to the guy I sat next to on the flight! We started by doing a cross word together before the plane took off and chatting the whole last two hours. Shoutout to the wonderful conversationalist Michael from Issaquah! 

To set the scene post excitment: I'm standing at baggage claim with Riley and Teal (two other gals from the program) and even though it's 11pm Seattle time, it's 8am Amsterdam time and that means I have more than 12 hours to go before I'm supposed to be sleeping. This, no surprise to anyone, turned out to be a bad time. We made it to the hotel in record time but had to find a way to kill time before our rooms were ready so me and some other students headed out on a walk based on vibes. That meaning we just walked until a cross streets and turned onto the one that seemed the most interesting. We continued that walk with a pizza stop in the middle and ended in a thrift store where I jokingly asked a fellow vibe walker "Is it just me or is the floor moving" and turns out it was, in fact, me getting vertigo due to being awake for more than 24 hours. 

After that we headed back to the hotel to just sit down and Riley was kind enough to let me nap in her (twin) bed with her since my bed wasn't ready yet. Orientation started up after the solid 2 hour nap and we walked around the DePijp neighborhood with one of Trent's former students as she led us through her neighborhood.

Overall the first day was long, tiring, and yet incredibly exciting. It was real nice to be able to hang out with people in a communally tired situation. We didn't have to talk but when we did it was to help keep each other awake and sentient.
