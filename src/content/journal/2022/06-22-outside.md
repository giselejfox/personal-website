# It's Okay to Be Outside in Amsterdam

The biggest culture difference I've noticed in my first week of Amsterdam is that it's okay to be outside.

For the duration of the 4 week program we're staying in DePijp, a part of Amsterdam known for it's street market, cute cafes, and beautiful park. The biggest aspect, or lack thereof, that catches my attention when I walk around the neighborhood is the amount of sound travelling through the air. There isn't much. 

Back home in Seattle I live near a major throughway and there's always noise coming at me. It berates me through the air out in my yard, through the windows to my room, and even shakes the floor when big trucks go flying by. I can't escape the commotion anytime I go down a street and I often find myself frazzled by the outside, just hoping to get some quiter time when I close my door. The only calmness I can find is in the parks when the trees absord all the excess motion but when an airplane flies overhead the quietness breaks even there. 

Not only does the noise make the outside uninviting but the public planning doesn't help either. Public space seem to be only suited for transportating yourself from one place to the next with few spots to comfortably sit down and relax. In order to sit down at restaurant outdoor seating you need to buy a full meal, a day at a park seems like a once in a while adventure, and it's not like you want to sit down next to a busy road anyways.

Here I feel different. I feel peaceful being outside. The city is built for people to walk, for people to bike, and for trams to come through. Cars seem to be an afterthought as they struggle to push through the crowds of people and bikes whizzing around. There are still cars on the street every once in a while, there's still hustle and bustle as people go about but it's not as industrial or seperated from reality. Everyone walking outside seems to be at ease and comfortable within themselves and being around other people. The outside is meant for people to take up space and share. It isn't a big deal to hang out in a park, it's a normal part of everyday life.

Even the cafes here are inviting and meant for people to take as long as they need. They're built for people to come with their friends and just take a couple hours to themselves as they chat. People are there reading books, people are there just to eat, it's as if the outside can be as comfortable and familiar as your own living room.

Since I've been here I've been living in a tiny room with another student that can just barely hold two twin sized beds but I haven't yet felt cramped. In reality I'm hardly in the room, I'm always outside maybe doing work in the breakfast nook on the ground floor or at a cafe nearby, or out exploring the city by foot or bike. The world seems so safe here and I'm not relegated to the indoors, or *my* indoors specifically, in order to feel recharged or at peace. It's made me more open to the idea of living in microstudio situation or with a bunch of other *respectful* people (as I am now) and then just using the outside equally as my own space. That's a reality I could see myself living in Amsterdam.
