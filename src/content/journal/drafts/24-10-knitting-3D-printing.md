# Knitting and Crochet as 3D Printing

- you're using a filament (yarn) to either build upon a steucture you're already making or create the base for another
- knitting and ceochet patterns are a series of code
- you can make increases/shapes unlike anything you can make from just a 2d material
- all without creating waste, or at least as much waste as what comes from cutting something away

- knitting and crocheting are ways of making more flexible and moldable 3D printed objects
- the materials can also be 100% biodegradable - you only are usingn fiber which can be something like 100% wool. you can chuck an item in the compost and it will thank you (TODO insert a link to how wool is good for compost)
    - it's a renewable material, at this point sheep need to be taken care of and sheared, if we don't 

- the beautiful things about is is you dont need any advanced technology, you dont need to invest in a printer or a fancy computer processing chip for modelling. you need either two sticks or a hook and your filamnet and that's it.

- there have been efforts to even merge the two (3d printing and crocheting) by allowing users to put a 3d model into a program and have it output a crochet patter
