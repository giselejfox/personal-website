### Green Alpaca Tie/Thneed

> Yarn: Handdyed and Handspun yarn from Orcas Island, bought at Seattle Recreative
> Cost: $
> Time: Est. 8 hours

TODO find the right yarn this came from
TODO find cost?

Inspired by brat summer this was originally slated to be a tie for a Charli XCX themed 'the Dare' costume. I got caught by the 'didn't check guage' and 'had too much fun knitting on our roadtrip' gremlins and it resulted in something that may have more functionality as a type of thneed. So far it can be a:

TODO add the photo collage of the different wearing possibilities.

1. Big long chuncky tie
2. Cute skinny scarf
3. Headwarmer
4. Colorful sash
5. Some sort of belt

The leftover yarn will get functioned into a the beginnings of a scrunchie.

### Sheep to Scarf

> Yarn: Handpun Icelandic and Finnsheep wool
> Price: $19 - two small bags of raw wool from Pink Moon Farms
> Time: Est. 28 hours (6? hours washing, 12? hours spinning, 10? hours knitting)

TODO get the date
I originally bought raw wool from Pink Moon Farms out in ___, and then set out to wash and dry in the backyard. It was a crash course in proper washing, drying, carding, and spinning. The first couple balls were completed by spindle and the vast majority sped right along when my spinning wheel came through.

I decided to give myself a treat and pay homage to this new era of personal fiber art by knitting a garter stich scarf, one of the simplest knitting items you can make.

TODO add the picture of me and the scarf

### Air dry Bowl

> Price: $17
> Time: Est. 3 hours

TODO get the place we went to
TODO add pictures
While in New Mexcio we went to ___, a cute little shop where you can get exceprional mixed drinks and play around with a pound of air dry clay. I ended up going with a bellpepper bowl for my necklaces and earrings. Once I was back in Seattle I went over with another pass of paint and modge podge for a shiny finish.

### Felted hat using leftover Noro Yarn

TODO: link to a Noro heart sweater link

I've already tried to make a knit had with the extra Noro yarn from my Noro Heart Sweater but had to frog is as it turned me into Oliver Twist. This was a fun way to experiment with leftover yarn and explore a new medium just in time for fall and winter!

TODO add collage/pics

### Handspun Dickie

> Price: $16
> Time: unknown

Made with the mode beautiful roving from Malabrigo Nube's collection called Diana. This is so incredibly soft and is so fun to look at with all the colors bouncing off each other. I usually wear it under by beige puffy coat and it acts as a perfect little scarf in the shape of a turtleneck.

## In Progress

### Alpaca Gradient Sweater

TODO check spelling magna opus

I'm hoping this will become my next magnum opus.

Not only will this be a sheep to sweater project (or more specifically an alpaca to sweater project), but I'm hoping to make it even more complicated by introducing a gradient effecâ€  to the stripes which means a lot of math and mixing fibers from the two coats to change the finished color of the yarn.

I'm still working on the solid striped yoke but I think my next steps will be the major plannng phase. I'll start doing test runs of mixing fiber with different percentages of each color, creating swatches, and estimating how much of each gradient level of yarn I'll need to comlete my sweater.

### Lopi MultiColored Jacket

TODO link the triple knit stitch
TODO link the pattern I reference
TODO link lettleopi yarn and make sure it's spelled correctly

I have this giant colorful chore coat that instantly becomes my entire personality when I wear it. I get compliments on it all the time and I'm starting to notice some wear and tear so I thought what better than to try and replicate the magic? I landed on trying to recreate this pattern but with this triple knit stitch, a stitch that results in a heavyweight fabric that looks the same from both sides! I'm using Lettlelopi yarn because they have an abundance of exciting colors, it's a yarn that's sturdier/scratchier/made for outerwear, and it's relatively on the cheaper side!

I even coded a quick page for me to test out the different colors I bought so I could check if they would look good together in the triple knit stitch.

I'm still working on the back panel, working in strips to give myself more small victories, but I'm already so excited from the colors and fabric that's coming out.

### Handspun Esther Jacket

Price: $35 (sheep's fleece), $85 (mill processing)
Time: 35 hours spinning, unknown knitting

I unlocked a new emotion after finishing spinning up the roving for this cardigan, I think it was a new level of pride. 

Back in April I went to the Shepard's festival in Enumclaw where I bought a full sheep's fleece from a shepard in Ellensburg. I dropped the fleece off at a Blue Mist Farm's stand where they processed it into a roving bump. After months of waiting I picked up the roving by bike closer to where I live in Seattle and spent a total of 35 hours spinning, plying, thwacking, and winding into skeins (the time doesn't include drying).

Now it's onto knitting my first charted pattern!

### A collection of Socks!

I'm in the delsional stage of knitting where I'm convinced I won't need to buy socks ever again. Thus begins the sock project of 2024 that's on hold because my needles broke...

TODO pictures of socks



TODO decide whether or not I should add this part
## Thinking about it...

### A Fiber Clay Craft Night with Friends

--- TODO collage of the different inspiration pictures

### A lavendar sweater similar to the one on the OA

I love the effect of her pale skin and blond hair against the pale purple, it's stnd out stunning. I have pale skin, don't have blond hair (more of a gingerish brown) but I hope I can acheive the same effect with a similar color. I also love the oversized nature of it, the ever so slightly slouchy collar is a what I'm looking for.

It would also be a fun venture into more scandinavian types of colorwork, something I haven't ventured into before.

Patterns I could use:
TODO insert the patterns and their links

--- TODO collage of the inspiration photo and the different patterns I've found that could achieve it

### Another Noro Heart Sweater 

My most beloved project would have to be my Noro Heart sweater. Though it receives by far the most compliments out of any I
