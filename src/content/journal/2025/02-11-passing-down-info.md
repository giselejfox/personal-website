# Information and Time Fascinations or The Time Capsule Paradox: How We Preserve Information Across Millennia

I am fascinated by how We transfer information throughout time because there's so many possibilities for how that information gets like what's the word corrupted. Enter

First, there's the thought that you would just go easy if you want something to information to be able to pass through time you should just write it down easy. But it's not that easy. Every single way we jot down information is destructible whether that's on paper just write it down on paper paper can get destroyed. It can age out. It can decompose write it down in stone, a little harder, but still can be etched out by something else. Even this idea that we have of the information going into the cloud there is no cloud. It's all servers and there is no like digital versus analog technology. In some capacity, there's nothing there's no cloud it is all physical media. There is a server there that has those zeros and ones encoded in it somehow physically and that can also be corrupted.

So we have the conundrum of information and coded being corrupted in some capacity or destroyed, but then we also have the idea that our culture changes throughout time and even if we were to write something down now and for it to be maintained for another 2000 years, but we wrote down could be indecipherable to someone in 2000 years like I would not be able to look at a sign in Latin and be able to understand what it means.
 in Latin and be able to understand what it means.
So there's a couple things that fascinate me about this or that I start to think about a lot and one is how religion is such an interesting way of conserving information in stories throughout time and secondly there's this idea of how to let civilization 2000 3000 10,000 years into the future know where radioactive waste is in why it's dangerous to go there.
 know where radioactive waste is in why it's dangerous to go there.
I'll start with the religion thing. First of all, it's wild that over the course of 2000 years we have stuck with the stories of of Jesus and his apostles and other Saints that came with him that those stories still stand to now that we know that this man existed back then, and with it are these incredible institutions that uphold these stories and uphold this sacred sort of knowledge to impart onto people and those stories, and that knowledge has been used for control and used for power and used for a personal gain, but in some capacity, those stories still ring true and that is fascinating that is oral tradition that is Culture that's so interesting. Looking at religion as an information system that permeates time and gathers people around some sort of central cause to keep on passing down this information by tapping into what we think of as God and spirituality is such an interesting and powerful thing. Thinking of spirituality as a conductor for information and story is something quite fascinating. I'll say it again.
 and story is something quite fascinating. I'll say it again.
Something else I think about a lot is this conundrum that designers come to when we start to think about radioactive waste and how to signal where where you active waste is because it's a dangerous substance that will not go away for another how many thousands of years and civilization changes a lot over thousands of years. Your first instinct might just put a radioactive symbol over the site or around the site with some gates but in I'm not sure 10,000 years that radioactive symbol might mean nothing to the people around it and maybe there's been some sort of weird apocalypse and we become people haven't seen this gate in 100 or 200 years and they have absolutely no idea what's behind it so how do we stop people from exploring these territories and uncovering radioactive waste that we know to be dangerous and need people to know to be dangerous. One thing we could do is create this religious sort of cult that is and viewed with the power, and we have to trust to be able to carry on information from now and into the future, translating throughout language translating throughout time that this space is unable because of radioactive waste, but really just keep the theory of this is not OK to go to keep that intention and meaning, alive and real. Another way to think of it is like make a drawings of people that are getting hurt by going into the radioactive waste hieroglyphic type of deal. How do we make sure that stands the test of time again paper disappears even like moss can grow on stones and cover things up. Do we make insane architecture that with giant spikes that look super scary keep people out of it. That's an interesting question to think about and I think about that a lot and I just wanted to voice to text that here.

# The Time Capsule Paradox: How We Preserve Information Across Millennia

Every time we try to send a message to the future, we face an intriguing paradox: the more time passes, the more likely our message is to either physically degrade or become culturally incomprehensible. This challenge of preserving information across time reveals fascinating insights about human civilization and our attempts to communicate across generations.

## The Fragility of Information

We often take for granted our ability to preserve information. "Just write it down," we might say. But it's never that simple. Every medium we use has its vulnerabilities:

Paper crumbles and decays. Stone erodes or gets covered by moss. Even our modern digital solutions—despite talk of "the cloud"—ultimately rely on physical servers storing bits of information that can corrupt or fail. There is no truly permanent storage medium; everything physical eventually degrades.

## The Language Barrier Across Time

Even if we somehow created an indestructible storage medium, we'd face another challenge: cultural and linguistic drift. A perfectly preserved message from today might be completely indecipherable to someone 2,000 years from now, just as many of us struggle to read ancient Latin inscriptions today.

## Religion as an Information System

This is where religious institutions present an fascinating case study in information preservation. Take Christianity, for example: for two millennia, the stories of Jesus and his apostles have been passed down through generations. While these religious institutions have certainly been used as instruments of power and control, they've also proved remarkably effective at preserving their core narratives.

What makes this preservation method particularly interesting is how it combines multiple approaches:

- Written texts
- Oral traditions
- Cultural practices
- Institutional structures
- Emotional and spiritual connection

By tapping into spirituality and creating communities dedicated to preserving and transmitting information, religions have solved both the physical preservation problem and the cultural translation problem.

## The Nuclear Waste Dilemma

Perhaps the most pressing modern example of this information preservation challenge is the nuclear waste warning message problem. How do we warn future civilizations about radioactive waste sites that will remain dangerous for thousands of years?

The proposed solutions are fascinating:

- Universal Symbols: But will a skull and crossbones or the radiation trefoil symbol mean anything in 10,000 years?
- Hostile Architecture: Some suggest creating imposing structures with menacing spikes—architecture that inherently communicates "stay away."
- Pictographic Stories: Others propose creating simple visual narratives showing the dangers, similar to ancient hieroglyphics.
- Atomic Priesthood: Perhaps most intriguingly, some have suggested creating a quasi-religious order tasked with preserving and translating the warning across generations—essentially copying religion's successful information preservation model.

## Looking Forward

These challenges force us to confront profound questions about human civilization and our ability to communicate across time. As we create more long-term hazards and amass more knowledge worth preserving, the question becomes increasingly urgent: How do we ensure our descendants understand what we need them to know?

The answer might lie in combining multiple approaches, just as religions do. Perhaps the future of information preservation isn't in choosing between physical monuments, digital storage, or cultural institutions, but in weaving them all together into something more resilient than any single method could be.

After all, the most successful information preservation systems in human history have never relied on just one technique—they've created redundant, multilayered systems that can survive both physical decay and cultural change.
