# A New Mexico Family Vacation on Film

A new trend I'm trying to embrace is going through a roll of film for each trip I go on. It's a fun little treat and I consider the cost of the roll of film and it's development as a vacation expense. Being more considerate about what I take pictures of results in me spending more time taking in my surroundings and the resulting photos become that more special and precious.

> Camera: Kodak M38, Film: Kodak Gold 200, Developed by: [Moody's Film Lab](https://www.moodysfilm.com/), Dates span: 10/5/24-10/12/24
