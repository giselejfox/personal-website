# Rock Rocks Rocks!!

On October 9th 2024 me and my family entered a new favorite museum: *New Mexico Bureau of Geology Mineral Museum*

There was no admission fee, a few posters scattered around, but mostly just cases and cases of the most beautiful minerals and rocks you've ever seen. I felt like I was walking through a collection of mystical, otherworldy objects. This was the first time I've had my jaw drop at a museum over and over again.
