# Intentional Design in Museums Connecting Past to Present
*2022-06-28*

The first day of our program we sat down in the breakfast nook of our hotel to discuss what were seemingly simple questions: what is a museum, what is a library, and what is an archive.

My group was assigned the museum question and we came up with a couple boundaries for what defines a museum. In general it's more public than an archive, a place that can usually only be accessed by professionals in the field, and more private than a library since people can't take the items on display home. We figured a museum is a curated portion of a larger collection and it's meant to be viewed by the public. It usually hosues physical objects and is designed in a way to be an informative and educational experience for the observer. 

Even though the museums have the static element of the artwork or other phyisical objects they have on display, the elements of design around them are malleable and able to be intentionally changed in order to convey a certain narrative. From the information they include on the placcards to the placement and lighting of the space and deciding what to emphasize, museums have a lot of information and design choices that have a big impact on the takeaways the visitors have to the space.

With that question in mind I had a new perspective to the museums we visited our first week. It drove me to analyze the design of the museum and how the curators decided to display the items rather than just the content of the artwork or items themselves. How were they designing their museum to be educational? What narrative were they aiming for? What experience were they trying to achieve?

For example, on our tour in Den Haag we visited the Mauritshuis, a museum that displays some of the notable artworks like "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" and "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp". It's undeniable that these pieces of art are a staple in the art world and it's also undeniable that they're housed in the mansion built by John Maurice of Nassau who's wealth was sourced from enslaving people. So how did the museum go about trying to design an experience for the viewer with those two truths in mind?

The staff at Mauritshaus is open to trying to tie these art pieces from roughly the 17th century into how we think about and interact with the present. On their website they mention that their collection can be tied to the need of the Black Lives Matter movement today (without really explaining how) and the experience of coronavirus today (again without giving details as to how).

In particular they're hosting an exhibit called [Flashback](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/what-s-on/exhibitions/flashback/) where they collaborate with modern day photographers to bring some of the historical artwork into the present.

So, instead of just putting up the art as a spectacle to come and look at, the Mauritshaus is investing in exhibits that tie the past to the present but have a ways to go when actively explaining the context that some of the art resides in from the past.

It was also interesting to see the intentionality of design in the Anne Frank house, a museum that recetly went through a very large renovation and redesign. Most notably it changed from a design that centered a christian-type narrative (beginning, middle, triumphant end) to what would be considered a more jewish-type narrative (no end or "unsatisfying" end). It was also interesting to think about what kind of context the museum would have to account for now that World War II ended almost 80 years ago. Even 30 years ago it was more likely that the people coming in had first hand experience with World War II. Now it's not so likely. 

Not only can museums iterate their design to keep people engaged with the past 100s of years ago, but they have to keep their eye on the amount of knowledge people come into the space with especially when the experiences they're working with are swiftly turning from first hand experience to second and to third. 

So, if museums are inherently educational and are curated and designed experiences, they share a burden of contextualizing the art they house for the modern day. Art and historical items can be displayed for light education and entertainment but when it comes to culture heritage you have to accomodate your design to tie into and educate based on the currrent situation.
