# OBA - Where the Library is High Value
*2022-06-30*

Today my mind was absolutely blown away by OBA Oosterdok, the main central Amsterdam library located towards the north of the city. We spent a couple hours there hearing about the new projects they were implementing, how they get their funding, and then taking tours around different parts of their facility.

## Everything was designed to market a high value product: the books

The one thing that most notably seperates Dutch libraries from American libraries is that you have to pay to get into the Dutch libraries. It varies from who you talk to but it's generally costs around 60 euros a year for any citizen to have access to the library system. 

When we asked the librarian today about why they had a subscription system in place she immediately told us she thought it was a stupid practice and it should be free but went on to say that they do it because it's a bit of a culture thing in the Netherlands. The Dutch has a notion that if something's free then it's not worth using so they charge poeple so they feel like it's a worthwhile experience to have. I think this then started to bleed over to the design of the library so they made sure that the books and the space seemed special and high value so people would be more inclined to come.

It doesn't even look like a library, it looked like a beautiful bookstore mixed with bite sized pieces of museums. All the shelves are white with a moden finish and are well lit in a dramatic white light. There were also little exhibits scattered around that drew people in and encouraged them to read more books about the topics at hand, it elevated the whole experience to a whole other level.

## It had an automated restocking system

This seemed to be more interesting to the MLIS (Masters of Library and Information Sciences) students who had experience working in a library than to me, a lowly undergraduate, but I'd be remiss if I didn't include it. After the books get dropped off at the book return booth on the ground floor, they get plopped onto a conveyor belt and automatically dropped off on the right floor they're supposed to be restocked at. An apparent marvel that blew everyone's mind.

## Even though it was modern and automated it was really homey

In the library area itself there were a ton of plants and comfy seating. It had the presence of a cozy bookstore and you didn't feel like you had to be quiet all the time while you were there. It wasn't one of those spaces where you immediately go quiet once you enter the space, you felt like you were entering a slightly more sophisticated public living room of sorts that was technically meant for getting work done. There was even a restaurant at the top (with a delicious variety of healthy and homey foods) and a cafe below that offered a darker and chicer starbucks-like seating area with any and all magazines displayed around for you to read.

## They partnered with organizations around to curate book collections
One of the programs they had in place was one called the [House of all Languages](https://www.oba.nl/hvat.html) where one wall on two floors is dedicated to a books curated by different organizations around Amsterdam to help celebrate the different cultural groups in Amsterdam. The library asks the organizations to give them a list of books to show and no questions asked their beautiful shelf area will be stocked with all the books that that organization thinks their groups will enjoy and that other Dutch populations will be able to learn from.

## They had no problem with people **not** wanting books on the shelves

Another question that got brought up to the librarians in our talks was: "what do you do when people don't want certain books on the shelves?". 

We were met with earnest confusion, "...what do you mean? I dont understand". And then we quickly realized that there is absolutely no problem with that in the Netherlands. There's no question about whether books with queer or non-queer intimacy can stay on the shelves, there's no fight about what's appropriate or not appropriate to share with kids. People are welcome to learn about what they want to learn about and it's not on the librarians to try and regulate the information the public has access to.

The figure above shows a small exhibit in the LGBT section on the history of drag kings in the netherlands. Something that seems so casual yet would be up for debate in most cities back in the US.

I was talking with it with some of the classmates during lunch afterwards and one even mentioned that they don't want to go back to be a librarian in their home town of Idaho because now a librarian can be jailed up to five 5 years if the community decides that what's on the shelf isn't appropriate. 

## All in all...

The library was beautiful, it seemed like an incredible feat of public space, and I hope some really cool and functional cross pollination occurs to help bring some of these ideas back to the US to help out our public spaces.
