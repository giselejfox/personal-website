Over the course of the last week we went to 2 different ethnographic museums, the Museum Vulkenkunde in Leiden and the Tropen Museum in Amsterdam. The conversations that we had afterwards brought up questions of cultural object restitution and whether or not we should have ethnographic museums in general anymore. Below I'll discuss some of the differences I've noticed between the two and the effects each had on us as viewers.

Right off the bat it's easy to say that we as a group did not enjoy the Museum Vulkenkunde in Leiden. Most of the objects were supposed to be used in various religious ceremonies and most if not all were aqcuired during colonial periods where consent for these items to be stolen and displayed wasn't held in high regard. The biggest touch point for me was that the displays didn't feel educational but it felt more like a display of power. There were cases and cases of cultural artifacts that lived in sterile cases and only a fraction actually had placcards with rich details on the contents within. All they seemed to do was blatently display objects in all the same light in what could easily be compared to a trophy case. It seemed like the museum just wanted us to be impressed at all the objects it held from other cultures. 

The low dramatic lighting highlighting the objects on clear and unfriendly glass displays not only gave off a monotonous impression but it made the act of looking at everything tiring. All you could do was move from case to case looking at the beautiful details of each item but that gets tiring fast. There was no element added to keep our attention engaged, no trying to take us through an experience, just putting things from other cultures on display for us to gawk at. It was obviously a colonialist view of how white people saw the rest of the world.

Their use of space and displaying things higher and lower seemed to be at odds with an equal type of display. For example, they placed an exhibit of African relics on the floor which meant it resulted in a landscape of mostly white visitors peering down at them.

The Tropen Museum, however, had a different approach. The Tropen Musuem is a colonial cultural heritage museum, definitely a hard subject to broach and a hard experience to get right. We were definitely skeptical going into this one after we all had some bones to pick with the Vulkenkunde museum just two days earlier. This one still had objects of other cultures displayed but the general experience was so much better. First of all the objects weren't on display just to be on display, they were on display to help tell a story. Each little case was carefully curated to help lead the viewer through the years from both the perspective of the Dutch and heavily centering the experiences of the cultures that were on the opposite end of the dutch colonial experience.

The first example that stood out to me was the case that showed off an Indonesian puppet that depicted a European colonist. In the placcard they not only talk about the materials and the time period it was made but it also put the puppet into the perspective of the people that made it. They pointed out that the large nose and beard that the puppet depicting the European had were also features that the artists commonly used to depict devils. 

In the Tropen museum there was also some obvious dedication to how the displays were designed for the viewer. In the slavery section, they took 3 photos of enslaved people that were taken at a slave auction, blurred out the photo from the chest down, turned it black and white, and set the portraits up high so the viewers would be looking up at the photos. They hoped that this spacing and design choices gave the people in the photos dignity since they still wanted to display the photos to show that human people were trafficked and enslaved. It's still unnerving to have those images displayed since the people in the photos obviously couldn't give consent for their topless photos to be on display in a famous museum for the eyes of thousands of viewers coming through.

## So what can we do?
The question that then comes up is how do you build an ethnographic museum without exploiting or detaining other culture's products? We came up with the following idea that I thought was really neat:

Do away with the cultural and religious objects on display and turn the ethnography museum into an art museum where artists of the current day can come in and tell in their stories. As said beautifully by Maina, another student in the program, the best way to learn about other cultures is to talk to people of that culture, you aren't going to learn about the culutres by looking at their cupboards
