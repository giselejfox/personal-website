# DOK - An Updated Library Space

On July 5th we headed to the Delf to check out the DOK, a library that had nailed what a modern yet inviting and community-based rendition of a library could be. It set aside the classic library model to offer a place where books were still the main feature but it both featured them in an updated way and allowed for the space to make room for other things as well.

## Designed for and by kids

Through the years of working at the library, the librarians had found that the standard way of sorting books on the shelves made it hard for kids to find what they were looking for. For kids, the SISO classification system (the dutch version of the Dewey Decimal System, a system for classifying books based on content) had a similar effect to trying to alphabetize a grocery store, it was technically organized but not in a way that seemed intuitive to the person coming in. What the system decided to do was invite kids to be [DOK designers](https://www.dok.info/jeugd/dok-designers.html) and get them in for what they called "pizza parties" to discuss a new way to categorize all the books in a way that would actually encourage reading and exploring that made sense to them. They succeeded and created a whole new organizational model that did away with sections like "history" (because that sounded like what they do in school and that's no fun) and replaced it with subsections like "a super long time ago" and "recently". I also noticed that the bookshelves seemed way more curated by series to children's interests than a regular library might, most notably when I can accross what seemed to be *the* Rick Riordan bookshelf.

The space itself was also noticeably inviting for children. There was generally a lot of open space between the shelves, the shelves weren't crowded with books in an overwhelming manner, and there were a ton of genuinely comfy seating options tucked away for people to relax in. I can totally see myself as a kid loving it there, finding new books in the sections I knew and sitting on the couch reading about all the new and cool things in this delicious grocery store of a library.

## Do adults really need books?

At first glace the library didn't center adults at all and that's the best part. Most of the book space in the library is focused on children's area on the second floor with the first floor dedicated to the adult books. From the way the building was layed out though the books on the first floor either just hugged the walls or were pushed into a room off the the side of the main area.

I think the library realized that in many cases adults don't really need a place where they can browse shelves and shelves of books, a quiet and inviting place to get work done is more useful. There were a lot of adults there while we touring even, many scattered about working on their own projects. 

This library had a cozy cafe that greeted you as you entered the building and the comfy seating that ornamented the kids department spread its way into the general area. There was also plenty of room for tables and chairs and extension cords to keep things plugged in if you wanted to work at a desk. The modern and homey coffee shop extended beyond the cafe itself and the general areas were filled with beautiful luscious plants and warm wood furnishings. It didn't feel stuffy like a museum, and it it didn't feel like a library, but it felt like your cool friend's apartment that you got to get cozy in. To me as an adult now, that's exactly the space I'd like to attend and work at if I got the chance.

## Modularity for community

Not only was the DOK designed in a way to meet the needs of adults and children alike but it also made itself useful for community gatherings the educational experiences. 

The library had rooms all around the back of the floors dedicated to different types of activities. There was one for music, a dance studio, an art studio, a pottery studio, all spaces that could get rented out to the public for around 70 euros for 1/2 a day.

My favorite thing by far though was the fact that the bookshelves in the children's section were on wheels! That meant that basically half a floor could get cleard in 10 minutes in order to host bigger events if they wanted. It didn't hurt when they wanted to build enclosed circles for group reading time or host the breakdancing class out there since apparently the floors were better than the dance studio. 

I love the idea of a modular design in this public space so that it can be refursbished into new and exciting spaces at the drop of the hat. It shows how we can seize how valuable the physical public space can be in general and how using the library space for new and exciting ways is a big part of keeping the library relevant and still valuable to the public in the modern day.

## PS Plants 
In any case, here's a quick view of the beauties in the library. I asked and apparently there's a company that comes in to take care of them, I wonder how I can get that job..?
