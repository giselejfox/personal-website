# How do I package myself?

I'm still trying to figure out how I should package myself, or how I should sort packages of myself.

Do I present myself all in one website like:
- [Romina Malta](https://romi.link/)
- [Maya Man](https://mayaontheinter.net/)

Or do I split myself up to keep a simple professional face while a more creative me who loves Georgia O'Keeffe runs wild somewhere?
