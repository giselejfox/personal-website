# An ode to splayed hands

Something I've enjoyed recently is an open hand as a signal accross the body.

## Dancing
I found one in [this tiktok dance](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNnvjBpC/) where halfway through the dance she covers her face with a splayed palm facing outwards and continues to dance normally with the rest of her body. I don't know why the anonymity in the midst of it gets me. Covering someone's face changes the entire mood. The entire atmosphere.

## Biking
I was also currently out on a group bike ride where someone reached their hand around to place their splayed hand on their back palm facing out. I liked seeing the contrast of his hand against his dark blue shirt. It wasn't a signal we had learned before going out but it has enough meaning all the same. Stop.

## Danger
One of the most iconinc shots in Cuckoo, the much anticipated horror movie of the summer, has the shadow of a splayed hand reaching towards the protagonist played by Hunter Schafer.
