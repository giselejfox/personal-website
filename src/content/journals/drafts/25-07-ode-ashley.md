I feel like I could expand on this some more
- Parasocial relationship
- Looking back on how I view her content differently
    - The impact of that one blooper video of her trying to say one thing right an get frustrated
    - Her talking about not feeling like a good enough person
- The stress of curating an image and what that looked like for me
- What it meant to me to see someone like her figure it out

- [THE ULTIMATE BEDROOM MAKEOVER + room tour - @bestdressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSHITL5oedk&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=4) - This video means so much to me. I had never seen a youtube video like this before. It was edited in a fun, spunky, yet professional way with someone who seemed so relateable and real like me. She wasn't trying to be a perfect snapshot of an unattainable persona, she was trying to be funny, trying to be scrappy, trying to follow her vision, trying to be honest. I now see this video a lot differently than when I first watched it. I see how much effort she did put behind editing a persona, not in a bad way but just a media literacy sort of way. I grew up with Ashley and have a one true (admittedly) parasocial space in my heart for her and this video was what started it all.
