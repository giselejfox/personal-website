# Give me my simple internet back

> Because thereâ€™s an endless amount of data available to us and we have a limited bandwidth to conserve, we might consider carefully curating the quality of what we allow in. - Rick Rubin, The Creative Act: A Way of Being

I've found myself feeling overwhelmed with algorithms deciding what I see and if that means I have to try and build my own RSS reader curated for all the cross-platform content creators I actually care about then so be it.

[Check out my curated, hand-built RSS reader here!](https://gisele-data-hub.vercel.app/)

Because I do like content. I do like reading, I do like watching, I just want my activities to have an end. Tiktok, Instagram, facebook, they don't have ends. I'm tired of the slog, I'm tired of the wormhole, I want to be responsible with and for my own time.

**Will you ever find new things again if you're trying to de-algorithmify your content?**

I will (surprisingly). Even with just a couple different channels in the first version of my RSS reader, both youtube and otherwise, I found myself diving deeper into what I already liked. I watched those videos that didn't catch my eye the first time around, I read the substack instead of skimming it. And the people I follow often give recommendations of other creators and the cycle continues. Now it's a game of exploring and poking around not a passive sit back and consume.

**Wait you're not going on scrollable sites ever again?**

Unfortunatley, I'm a human in the modern age with a couple worms in my brain. But with my own curated chronological timeline of content at my fingertips at least I'll have a place to start when I'm looking for something to do on my phone that's not tiktok or instagram.

**What even is an RSS reader?**

Here's an example of an RSS feed: [Seattle Times Local News RSS Feed](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/feed/)

RSS feeds are online files accessible to the public and hosted by someone with an online platform (blog, news outlet, etc). The feeds give some basic information about each new piece of content that get's released, at the least a title, publication date, and URL to the post.

The idea is is that you can use some fancy shamncy RSS reader (if you don't make your own storebought is fine) that hooks up to all these RSS feeds and gives you a timeline of all the content you specifically care about.

**Do Youtube Channels have RSS feeds though?**

They should! But they dont... So I'm having to do some API work too in order to get feeds I care about from other platforms. It's very likely I will have more non-RSS feed content in there than what I do get from RSS feeds. C'est la vie.

## Other notable mentions for a non-algorithmic content experience
- AMC A-list - Just for ~$25 a month I get to see up to 3 movies a week in the theater, that means a movie going experience can possibly cost me just a tad over $2 if I really dedicate myself. I coordinate with my friends who also have the membership (and bring my own snacks). There's a start and an end, there's community, there's discussion, and I get to see beautiful movies I wouldn't have otherwise. All the way from [Kneecap](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27367464/) to [Deadpool and Wolverine](imdb.com/title/tt6263850)

- [are.na](https://www.are.na/) - Though it is scrollable it's not based around an algorithm and there aren't any ads. I genuinely feel inspired by the content and it's a digital equivalent of leafing through the coolest book and getting to organize my findings.

- [Dropout.tv](https://www.dropout.tv/) - A streaming service with just one video released every weekday (sometimes there's two for a little treat). It features on a relatively small cast of characters with a focus on improv that spans cooking shows, tabletop RPGs, and game shows. There's so much life and laughter in the archive and more coming out at a respectful pace all the time.
