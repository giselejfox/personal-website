# My Georgia O'Keeffe
On October 7th I went to the Georgia O'Keeffe museum in Santa Fe and not only learned more about her artistry but about how she carefully crafted her life and personal style.

What stood out to me:
- She had a very [particular eye for style and clothing](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/georgia-okeeffes-powerful-personal-style) - She would focus on simple outfits, often sticking to black and white. She would make her own garments and if she found a pattern or form she liked she would get the item remade by a local artisan. She also wore somewhat of an androgynous style, sticking to her own needs and expression.
- She was attached to and inspired by architecture, even [waiting 10 years](https://www.ghostranch.org/georgia-okeeffe/) to be able to buy a house she was in love with.
- She had vast collections of things. I'm most interested in her [shell collection](https://www.artic.edu/articles/838/okeeffes-shells-and-bones).
- She enjoyed being alone.
- She often went on [camping trips](https://www.georgiaokeeffe.net/black-place.jsp) around New Mexico, using the experience to sketch, photograph, and paint the landscapes.
