### Nomadland, Julia Brunner

> The economy is a game. This game should be about non-essential things (motorcycles, computers, televisions). A person feeding their family, staying alive, having shelter... that should not be subject to a economy. - Statement on Michael Reynolds website

> Workampers are plug-and-play labor, the epitome of convinience for employers in search of seasonal staffing. They appear when they are needed. They bring their own homes, transforming trailer parks into ephemeral company towns that empty out once their jobs are gone. They aren't around long enough to unionize. On jobs that are physically difficult, many are too tired eeven to socialize after their shifts.

> "One of the depressing parts was I knew all this stuff was going to end up in the landfill." That part demoralized her. "You think about all the reosurces it took to get it there." She mused. "And then it's 'Use it up. Throw it away.'" - One of the workampers musing on what it's like to work in an Amazon warehouse.

> Sameer and LaVonne were not naive. They knew that, in the eyes of the law, they are homeless. But who can live under the weight of that work? The term 'homeless' has metastasized beyond it's legal definition, becoming a terrible threat.

### Parable of the Sower, Octavia E. Butler

> All I do is observe and take notes, trying to put things down in ways that are as powerful, as simple, and as direct as I feel them.

> The thing is, even with my writing problems, every time I understand a little more, I wonder why it's taken me so long-- why there was ever a time when I didn't understand a thing so obvious real and true.

### Factfulness, Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund, and Ola Rosling

> Knowing that most people are deluded means you don’t need to be embarrassed. Instead you can be curious: how does the illusion work?

### The Creative Act: A Way of Being, Rick Rubin
> If something strikes me as interesting or beautiful, first I live that experience. Only afterward might I attempt to understand it.

> Creativity is a fundamental aspect of being human.

> Because there’s an endless amount of data available to us and we have a limited bandwidth to conserve, we might consider carefully curating the quality of what we allow in.

> The experience of our inner world is often completely overlooked.

### Blockchain Chicken Farm: And Other Stories of Tech in China, Xiaowei Wang

> One farmer told me that the future is a created concept, and that in the fields, in the long dark of winters, there is no future, because every day depends on tending to the present moment. An act of care. In contrast, urban culture is centered on the belief that the universe must be constantly corrected on its course, and that life is defined by the pleasure of overcoming future challenges.

> As Matilda mentioned to me in Shanghai, information about food is central to food safety. This makes industrialized farming, including modern pig farming, an information business, with a focus on scaling trust.

> My mother’s is the kind of job that some people think robots should take over, that should be optimized and automated. After all, she would supposedly get more free time and fulfillment in life. The irony is, she stopped feeling fulfilled when her workplace became optimized, her work stripped of meaning, turned into mere labor.

### So You Want to Talk About Race, Ijeoma Oluo

> The number of people I’d be leaving behind and continuing to oppress by refusing to check my privilege would make my efforts ineffective at best and harmful at worst.

> Get used to that uncomfortable feeling that arises when you discover that perhaps your privilege is hindering your ability to truly understand or address an issue. Get used to that pang of guilt that comes with realizing yet another area of life where you’ve benefited at the expense of others. It will not kill you.

> Our police force was not created to serve black Americans; it was created to police black Americans and serve white Americans.

> The assumption that police officers would serve and protect the white community has existed as long as the assumption that police officers would control people of color.

> When you say that a representational number of women or people of color cuts out more deserving white men, you are saying that women and people of color deserve to be less represented in our schools and our companies and that white men are deserving of an over-representational majority of these spots.
