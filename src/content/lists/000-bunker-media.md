# My Bunker Media

*Last Updated: 2025-07-22*

A growing list of pieces of media I'd want to archive and keep with me forever in case the internet apocalypse happened.

## Podcasts
- [Confronting a Gay Historian - So True with Caleb Hearon](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6d0NkK1sYeX64er3xhz1NK?si=9a9c5ce068a34b10) - A beautiful glimpse into a queer intergenerational frienship, the historical importance of gay bars as a way of information distribution, and a man's life who doesn't own a phone.
- Girls Rewatch / Lena Dunham on Girls Rewatch Podcast [[Part 1]](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7oE7kYkwLBIFNwkLElR7Oy?si=68b64cd7e8f7432c) [[Part 2]](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Nw3kRQCZdtt9Iglzi0xTX?si=44bb9044ebe44288) - Listening to Lena talk about how hard on herself as a 20-something year old and how hard the world was on her gave me some much needed perspective on how I treat myself in own point in life. I often feel so guilty and distraught over small actions I might have done wrong or when I didn't do something in the most efficient manner. But I'm not an axe murderer. I haven't hit someone with my car and ran. I've been occasionally snippy and distant with people when in a bad mood. I've been human and I've learned how to be more communicative and take time for myself. It's okay. 

## Youtube Videos
- [Architectâ€™s Micro Studio Apartment - @livingbig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFu7zE9DnRA&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=45) - I think this is the most beautiful use of space. I strive to emulate Douglas Wan's modular and clean work in every space I live in.
- [I run untested, viewer-submitted code on my 500-LED christmas tree. - @Matt_Parker_2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7eHTNm1YtU&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=43) - This is what the internet's all about. Just pure nerdy whimsey.
- [Operation Jakey-Jakes and Ry-Ry - Funny 'Life' Interview (2017) - @RottenTomatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5_jc3LGdE&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=41) - This is first of all an incredibly funny video but also touches on something a little deeper. In this video you can tell Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Renolds have obviosuly been absolutely slammed by their press junket for this movie they're promoting, they can hardly keep it together, and the interviewer is able to put aside their needs for a moment and just let them ramble. Then, once they've all composed themselves, she actually asks them a question they genuinely get excited about. A question so simple that they don't have to wrack their brains to give a deep thoughtful answer but it still shows an insight into what would have affected them while working on the movie. It shows a deep respect for the actors and actually allows them to talk about what their experience was day to day on set instead of trying to manufacture an experience of grandiosity about what it means to work on a movie. As someone who used to work in the fashion industry modeling for runway shows, I literally cried when I was given soft moccasins to wear instead of heels that were too small for me and were going to give me blisters. That experience of day to day comfort in a usually uncomfortable situation on set (or backstage at a runway show) is not the air of grandiosity people want to hear about but it's the day to day meaningful moments for those in them. 
- [Katelyn Ohashi - 10.0 Floor (1-12-19) - @uclaathletics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ic7RNS4Dfo&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=15) - This is the ultimate feel good/proud/impressed/amazed video.
- [THE ULTIMATE BEDROOM MAKEOVER + room tour - @bestdressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSHITL5oedk&list=PL6PpvL5MZA-qs14aoI4FGkaH32dKACrj-&index=4) - This video means so much to me. I had never seen a youtube video like this before. It was edited in a fun, spunky, yet professional way with someone who seemed so relateable and real like me. She wasn't trying to be a perfect snapshot of an unattainable persona, she was trying to be funny, trying to be scrappy, trying to follow her vision, trying to be honest. I now see this video a lot differently than when I first watched it. I see how much effort she did put behind editing a persona, not in a bad way but just a media literacy sort of way. I grew up with Ashley and have a one true (admittedly) parasocial space in my heart for her and this video was what started it all.

## Misc Short Form Content
- [Why they got me looking like Iâ€™m on the run from EVERYTHING ðŸ˜‚ (this is real but just laugh/make jokes it is okay) - @trevor_norris0](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMWp-V5NFP2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) - So silly so funny. I don't think I've laughed out loud watching a little video more than this one.

## Movies
- [About Time (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499) - I watch this movie every year and (even though it has a stalker plot) I can't help but love the innate feel good sentimentality it brings to the table around the beauty of life. How if you simply look around and the small moments of the day, every day is special.
- [I Saw the TV Glow (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15574270) - I don't think a movie has scared me more than this one, it hits at the existensial level of what life could be like if you don't honor your true self. It's not a story where everyone makes the right decidions to be happy in the end. It's a story that warns you about what will happen when you don't make decisions and don't become yourself. 

## Books
- [Parable of the Sower (1993) - Octavia Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_(novel)) - I love a gritty book about survival where the character has to make plans, make realistic choices, have forethought. It sets a solid foundation of reality that we can jump off of and delve into themes like spirituality and community and trust between strangers in untrustworthy settings.
