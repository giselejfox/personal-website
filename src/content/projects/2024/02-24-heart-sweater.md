## process
The yarn for this project was my gift to msyelf after getting my first big kid job out of college! I had been obsessed with this image (pictured below) for at least a year and was so excited to be able to get all my yarn at once and dive right in.

This was my first true colorwork project and knitting it with Noro Kureyon's self-striping wool yarn made it all the more fun. It felt like I was knitting with candy.

In the end it turned out a little small in the arms so down the line (when room in my knitting queue opens up) I'm going to try to redo it with different colors and make it a little bit bigger.
