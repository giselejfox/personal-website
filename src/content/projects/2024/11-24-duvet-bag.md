## process
I recently got new duvet covers -- one of the many marks of moving into adulthood. Not wanting to let go of my old duvet cover I've had since 8th grade I decided to turn it into a bag so it can have a new life while still being close to me.

I started by using the small ridges on my duvet cover as a guide for ripping a long, even, spiraling strip of fabric to use as my yarn. I knit it up using large US 15/10mm needles in a twisted stitch. Overall it was pretty easy and the end product is a surprisingly heavy bag that somewhat resembles a fancy [Bottega Veneta woven bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/hobos/bottega-veneta-leather-veneta-hobo-large-n7k31?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=organic+shopping&utm_product=BOT279964).
