# Wall art made from old Wired Magazines

## inspiration

On Pinterest I started getting drawn to posters of somewhat ambiguous colorful blobs. As I was thinking about how to make some wall art for myself I thought about doing watercolors, maybe crayons, but then I realized I had the perfect source for ambiguous colorful paper: old wired magazines.

I make my mom give me all her wired magazines because I love using their pages for collaging. Usually I just cut out the parts that are a single block of color but I had been leaving behind all the rest. The graphics are gorgeous, I even have one of the pages framed as art in my hallway because it's just that easy to appreciate.

## process 

I picked up this frame and art off the side of the road a couple weeks back because I liked the size of the frame. Finally I sat down to transform it by taking the cardstock out of the frame and simply turning it around for a blank canvas. The rest was easy, just outline different sized circles on the colorful wired pages and watch my new piece of wall art come to life.
